# Homebase

In an attempt to keep better track of time I created a progress bar which gradually fills up as the hour progresses.  

I decided to add a couple of more features such as displaying the local weather and a list of tasks to accomplish during the day. 

This clock was partially inspired by https://github.com/robatron/1440-clock
